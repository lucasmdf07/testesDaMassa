	<p>   Hello everyone! I am Hans Garrett Peterson. I'm a 21-year-old currently studying Software Engineering at BYUI. I am from Rigby, Idaho. I have spend my whole life living in Southeastern Idaho. It is definitely an amazing place to live. My favorite things to do are to spend time outside, swim, and play sports/video games. But among my favorite activities would be programming. Writing code is often accompanied by unique challenges which can actually feel really rewarding to figure out. I am excited to learn more about web development this semester!</p>
